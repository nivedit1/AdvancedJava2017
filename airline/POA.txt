Following is my plan of attack for project 1:

I will first write my Airline class which extends AbstractAirline class which has methods getName() which returns the name of the airline, getFlights() which returns the flights for that particular airline and addFlights() which adds a given flight to an airline.

Then I will edit my Flight class which extends AbstractFlight class. I will edit 4 methods - getSource() and getDestination() which accepts only airport codes that are of 3 characters and throws an IllegalStateException otherwise. I will then edit the getDepartureString() and getArrivalString() methods to accept dates only of the format given in the specification - mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm. I am planning to implement this by comparing the command line argument with a regular expression.

Then I will edit my Project1 class to parse the command line arguments. In this, I will implement logic for the program to print out a "READ ME" whenever there is a -README option in the command line arguments. Also if there is a -PRINT option in the command line arguments, I will call the toString() method of the Flight class to print the flight details. 

I also have to implement logic for the program to gracefully exit if one of the following occurs:
 - Flight Number is numeric and not alphanumeric
 - Not enough command line arguments
 - If the departure and arrival date format is not according to the specification
 - If the source and destination airport code is not 3 characters
